+-----------------------------------
FROM THE start
- in header give link paths index.html?c=controller&a=action
- make a grid, edit and add and design it 

- now as i gave paths like controller i have to make controller files for all apps

- after it, i have to define a = action like grid fetch etc and i have to require files
that to be shown while i try to fetch something

- so, after making controller statically this is how 
from input i get vaalues as > name="name", value=""
name > key , value = value 
$_POST['name'] // if i gave method post in form action 

- instead of that, pass arrayname in each key of input tag 
- so it will give data as (product (key => value, name => 'mohit', email => 'rms@gmail.com'))

- now to post this data on db, i check key and value errors in this array 
like if array key or value is null, however show the data 
- for that i have to make Request file and make functions  
getPost() function for $_POST method (if i write in insertAction print_r($_POST['product']) 
it will not show any errors means in Requ)est class, function is only made for validation 

> so Request file is only for validation of $_GET and $_POST methods

> now for $_GET > statically i was getting link > $link = $_GET['id']
> now if i want to validate links also 
> make functino in Request class > getParam 
- now inside this, $_GET method is called so, i have to go through it for validation 

> how validation is performed? 
> instead  of getting id directly, i call and access the Request class and 
validate link and pass it  into product controller 

------------- FROM HERE, THIGNS CHANGES 
> now in request class, i make 2 funcitons > getActionName and getControllerName

- why ? to define which action and controller is being used 

> action to perform thase but which action to be performed? 
> in static method kevi rite krta ta?

> front ma Request model ne access kryo chhe atle aapde front ma action ne e 
badhuy perform kryu chhe 

> product mathi > request ma check karavyu
> but have request mathi > Front ma gaya 
atle product ni actions Front ma perform thai sake 
> front ma comment kareli chhe
